## Getting an Account

* I'll send you an email with your password. 
* Go to [https://cumulus.parisdescartes.fr](https://cumulus.parisdescartes.fr)
	* **immediately change your password**
* Create a new virtual machine
	
## Creating new Virtual Machines (VM)

* Choose a template for an OS. If you want to use my install script, choose Ubuntu 16.10 (on page 2)
* Choose your preferred machine capacity
* Choose a network interface. There is only one choice, but you need to click on it.
* Give the VM a sensible, short name. Josephine could call hers *jose-1* for example. no special signs please (like @ or ?!\|{} etc)
* click on create
